# Projects
The main.py file is an example of how a python script can be used to output the host name and ip address.

The Chromebook vimrc file serves as an example. It contains settings for vim-airline as well as a function to remove trailing whitespace.

Ultimately, this project will serve as a learning experience. The Git commands used to create this project are:
	git clone "...."
	git init
	git add -A
	git commit -m "...."
	git pull origin master
	git push origin master

This project was inspired by Corey Schafer's YouTube channel.
